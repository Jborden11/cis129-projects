#Printing a short story
print(A young boy running for his life from a pack of wolves, Notices that his path is leading to a cliff.)
print(As he stops right at the edge he looks down, knowing he will surely die if he doesn't jump he shuts his eyes tight and leaps.)
Print(The boy is hit with a surge of cold as he gasps for air, he fights the current of water desperately trying to reach land.)
print(Slowly the boys stregnth fading he begins to give up hope, until a hand grabs him and pulls him out.)
